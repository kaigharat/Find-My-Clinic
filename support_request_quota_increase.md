Subject: Request for Quota Increase and Service Status Update

Dear Support Team,

I am currently experiencing persistent "Service temporarily unavailable due to high demand" errors with your API services (Supabase and Gemini). This issue severely impacts the functionality of our application, especially the symptoms analysis feature.

Could you please:

1. Confirm if there are any ongoing service disruptions or maintenance events.
2. Provide details on usage quotas and whether our project has exceeded limits recently.
3. Assist us in increasing our current quota limits or guide us through the upgrade process.

Your prompt assistance will help us maintain service reliability and improve user experience.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
