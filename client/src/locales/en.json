Our founders experienced firsthand the frustration of long, uncertain waits at clinics and witnessed the burnout affecting healthcare staff managing chaotic queues.",
      "paragraph2": "We realized that the gap wasn't in medical expertise—it was in information flow. Patients needed to know when to arrive, and clinics needed tools to manage their patient flow efficiently. This insight led to the creation of our platform that bridges this information gap with real-time queue management.",
      "paragraph3": "Today, Find My Clinic serves as a comprehensive solution that not only reduces wait times and stress for patients but also alleviates administrative burden for healthcare providers. We're proud to be building technology that makes healthcare more human and accessible for everyone."
